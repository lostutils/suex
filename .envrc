# .envrc is the configuration file for direnv.

# direnv is an environment switcher for the shell.
# It knows how to hook into bash, zsh, tcsh and fish shell
# to load or unload environment variables depending on the current directory.

# This allows project-specific environment variables without cluttering the ~/.profile file.
